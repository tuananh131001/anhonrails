# Background

Everyday of my work, I need to open jira and ticktick, etc. The Jira dashboard is overload with many feature and I just want to focus on my work only

# Goals
I'm building a personal dashboard website, where we can integrate with other external service like Jira, Notion, Ticktick.

# Content
At first I will try to do a website using Ruby On Rails with simple design to list out all of ticket and todos from Jira and Ticktick
